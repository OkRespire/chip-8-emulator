# Chip-8 Emulator 


## Used the following guide + repositories as huge helps (I am very new to Rust)
- [Tobias V. Langhoff's guide](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/#prerequisites)
- [WASM Rust chip-8 emulator](https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/wasm-rust-chip8/tree/master)
- Have not tested it in GUI (still needs to be created)
